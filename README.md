# Data_Collection_Challenge

Mars, also known as the Red Planet, is a planet that has attracted significant attention from scientists and space agencies worldwide. The exploration of Mars has provided valuable information and insights into the planet's atmosphere, geology, and climate. In this project, data were scraped from the Mars news site and the Mars Temperature Data site to analyze the planet's climate and temperature patterns. 
## Analysis
The findings show that there are 12 months on Mars, with 1867 Martian days worth of data in the scraped dataset. The coldest and warmest months on Mars were identified, and the average minimum daily temperature by month and day were analyzed. According to my findings, the atmospheric pressure is lowest in the sixth month and highest in the ninth. Additionally, the study found that there are 705.549 Earth days in a Martian year, and on average, the third month has the coldest minimum temperature on Mars, while the eighth month is the warmest. 
The study provides valuable information that could contribute to future exploration and research of Mars.
